Car udp listener process:

1. start-up
   - disable all systems
   - get system health
   - prepare udp listener

2. wait
   - wait for command
   - reset watch dog flag

3. action/ respond
    - parse data commands
    - maintain watch dog
    - if timeout throw watch dog flag and set stop
    - health and data request do not clear watch dog flag


Car udp sender/controller process:

1. initialize thread
    - init all thread and system data
    - connect to car and poll for system health

2. begin control
    - send command data to car
    - maintain communication rate within cars watch dog timer

3. stop control
    - let car timeout or issue stop command


Might need to get fancy with sending and recving the cars battery level as a decimal:
    - round to int (lame)
    - use 2 bytes
        - first byte is V
        - second byte is 10 * mV
        - voltage = V + (10 * mv)
