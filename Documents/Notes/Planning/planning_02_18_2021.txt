* Need to confirm gps lib works, fix if it does not
* Need to add 2D velocity, 2D distance calculations, 2D bearing (deg or rads), convert decimal to minute to GPS library
* Need to setup each sensor as a singleton, if the port is already busy DO NOT START !!!

* Need to package everything so it can used and intalled properly
    - make an install script (will install the required dependencies as well)
    - make a packing script

SF general algo:
1. call calibration function
   get base gps values
   zero imu if needed

2. start loop
    # check if new gps data is available or new flag is set by gps (new data)
    if true:
        i. dead reckon the system and calculate the states
        ii. reset the velocity logger (if this is too frequent do every other)
    if false:
        i. predict the current location and states
