* Need to setup each sensor as a singleton, if the port is already busy DO NOT START !!!
* Need to add 2D velocity, 2D distance calculations, 2D bearing (deg or rads), convert decimal to minute to GPS library
* Need at exit for gps & imu (done)

Testing:
	1. ensure every function outputs a value
	2. double check the zeroing functions work (if applies)
	3. double check the calculations work
	4. Plot output data over a set period of time, or output to file
	5. Display and Control UI (Tk)
		i. requires everything to be packaged properly so imports work
	
General:
	1. System Diagram
		i. hardware
		ii. software (object diagram, done)
	2. Class Diagram (done)
	3. Activity Diagram (define the functionality)
		i. general operation (done)
		ii. sensors & sensor fusion (done)
		iii. path planning/following (done)
		iv. obstacle detection & avoidance (done)
