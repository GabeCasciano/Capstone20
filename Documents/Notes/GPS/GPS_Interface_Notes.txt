__init__:
    Parameters:
        loc - location of the gps serial port in computer (ex. /dev/ttyACM0)
        baud - baud rate of gps serial port

        Process:
            - Creates and opens serial port for GPS
            - Initializes all values to 0
            - Creates a GPS worker thread (worker thread is required to be started externally)

run:
    Parameters:
        - none

        Process:
            - if running boolean is true the thread will continue to run
            - Reads the NMEA sentence from the GPS over serial
            - Splits the sentence at every ','
            - Reads the command (first word in sentence)
            - Chooses the corresponding parse function

parse_GGA, parse_GGL, parse_RMA, parse_RMC, parse_TRF, parse_VBW, parse_VTG:
    Parameters:
        data - remaining NMEA sentence sent by GPS after command has been extracted (list)

        Process:
            - Checks if there list is of the correct size
            - Parses and converts information from sentence into correct formats

haversin:
    Parameters:
        lat1 - destination latitude in degrees
        lon1 - destination longitude in degrees
        lat2 - current latitude in degrees
        lon2 - current lonitude in degrees

        Process:
            - uses the haversin formula to calculate the distance between two points along the surface on the earth

convert_min_to_decimal
    Parameters:
        position - position in dms (string)

        Process:
            - uses conversion values to convert between dms to position in degrees

get_velocity
    - returns the most recent ground speed

get_position
    - returns a list of current lat & long in degrees

get_latitude
    - return most recent latitude

get_longitude
    - return most recent longitude

zero_location
    - takes the current position as the relative position

get_relative_distance
    - calculates the haversin distance between relative and current positions

get_relative_bearing
    - calculates the angle with current and relative position, returns bearing from "True"

get_distance_to
    Parameters:
        goal - list of position (lat & lon)

    - returns the haversin distance between the goal and current position
